&lt;size=20&gt;RimBank&lt;/size&gt;
[Core mod,must be loaded before any of its sub mods]

??????????????,?????

First let me introduce 4 authors (contributors) of this mod (Label's not wide enough XD).
user19990313(ArchAuthor,Dll parts), duduluu(Textures+Preview.png), Vaniant(Defs), WishingLaws(En translation)

It is universally known (at least on this planet), Silver serves as the currency of RimWorld. Well, the white soft metal is heavy, ugly (why -7 Tynan?) and takes up countless storage zones.

That's why RimBank has developed the Banknotes.

Item added : Banknotes
-A denomination of 1,000 Silver, which never changes
-Light and durable, suitable for saving a considerable amount of money
-Accepted by any traders, so just keep some silver for change
-Available in any purchase
-New UI , deciding how much you want to pay by banknotes
-Orbital tradeships and settlements loves banknotes! And they have many as well!
-And yes, traders can give change using Silver, so no value overflows for banknotes!
-Exchange between Silver and Banknotes with any traders! (At least traders should have enough currency for this)

Building Added : RimBank ATM Terminal
-Minifiable and relatively inexpensive
-Exchange between Silver and Banknotes with RimBank at any time! (Extra fees required)
-Various extension softwares (sub mods required)

Extra Features
-Add it to your game at any time! Opening a new save is NOT required.
-Remove it from your game at any time without corrupting your saves! (See below)

HowTo
1.Load this mod after Core.
2.So that's all.
3.When trying to remove this mod,make sure you have an ATM Terminal. Select a colonist, HOLD Shift key and right-click the terminal, then (don't release key) select "Remove all mod contents". If there are any active sub mods, please make sure all the removing commands for those sub mods have been executed.

Enjoy!

PS. The new building is in "Misc" category, and will be unlocked if you've finished the research "Microelectronics Basics".
PS2. If you get stuck while solving a payment, try to stop your mouse over icons or title - A tooltip will emerge and lead the way.
PS3. The coremod of RimBank Series (aka this mod) and all sub mods must have the same MinorVersion number. Well if you cannot figure out what I'm talking about, just ignore it, a built-in ModChecker will take charge of it.
PS4. (That was a joke in RuntimeGC)
PS5. Post any errors or bugs on my forum thread or Steam workshop page.Your effort contributes to a better mod.Thanks!
