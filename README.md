If you find the mod useful,why don't you click "Thumbs Up"? :) Thanks!

It is universally known (at least on this planet), Silver serves as the currency of RimWorld. Well, the white soft metal is heavy, ugly [spoiler](why -7 Tynan?)[/spoiler] and takes up countless storage zones.

That's why ***RimBank*** has developed the Banknotes.


# Item added : Banknotes

-A denomination of <ins>1,000 Silver</ins>, which never changes
-Light and durable, suitable for saving a considerable amount of money
-<ins>Accepted by any traders</ins>, so just keep some silver for change
-Available in any purchase
-New UI , deciding how much you want to pay by banknotes
-Orbital tradeships and settlements loves banknotes! And they have many as well!
-And yes, traders can give change using Silver, so no value overflows for banknotes!
-<ins>Exchange between Silver and Banknotes</ins> with any traders! (At least traders should have enough currency for this)

# Building Added : RimBank ATM Terminal

-<ins>Minifiable</ins> and relatively inexpensive
-Exchange between Silver and Banknotes with RimBank at any time! (Extra fees required)
-<ins>Various extension softwares</ins> (sub mods required)

PS3. The coremod of RimBank Series (aka this mod) and all sub mods must have the same MinorVersion number. Well if you cannot figure out what I'm talking about, just ignore it, a built-in ModChecker will take charge of it.
